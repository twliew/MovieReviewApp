## MyPage (About Movies):
- Displays all movies that have an average rating of 4 or higher (shows the best rated movies)
- Movie name, average rating, and a link to a trailer is displayed on the left hand side
- User is able to select one of the displayed movies from drop down
- Drop down displays the description, links a movie review article, and shows movie poster
- Only 5 sample movies used for this feature, listed below

| Movie Sample |
|---------- |
| Forest Gump  |
| Anne B. Real    |
| Troll 2    |
| Beauty and the Beast    |
| All Quiet on the Western Front     |

- After user selects a movie from dropdown, there is a textfield below where they can input a link that updates the movies table, attribute "trailer"
- Once the user clicks the update button, the page refreshes and the changes can be seen on the left hand side (updates the link to trailer)
- One assumption: user will input a link in the textfield (no error handling). If textfield empty and button is clicked, nothing will update or refresh
- Note: this feature works for any movie displayed on this page
